        <h1>Thank you for supporting us.</h1>
        <p>
          Our original mission was to create open API project that every map application could contribute to it, similar to OpenStreetMap. 
          Even though we've created infrastructure, review process, bots, API, replication, it's only OsmAnd Android that used integration point.
          Though due to very sophisticated setup as a Public Blockchain, it took too much resources to maintain and project has been discontinued.
        </p>
        <p>As alternative project we recommend to look at  <a href="https://mangrove.reviews/" target="_blank">Mangrove reviews</a> which has a sustinable growth through years.</p>
        <p>The main result of the project is a OpenDB blockchain that stores and processes lots of information and 
          provides SQL database access with indexes - <b><a href="https://github.com/OpenPlaceReviews/opendb" target="_blank">OpenDB GitHub</a></b>. 
          Blockchain serves the purpose of Public API, including replication and guarantees openness for everybody, SQL database provides full access to process 10 M objects in a reasonable time.
        </p>
        <p><a href="/backup">The contributed data</a> (~4000 uploaded images on IPFS) to the project and the <a href="/data">blockchain metadata</a> will be avilable under <b>Public Domain license</b> for next 3 months. </p>
