        <h1>Thank you for supporting us.</h1>
        <p>
          Our original mission was to create an open API project that every map application could contribute to, similar to OpenStreetMap. Even though we've created infrastructure, a review process, bots, and an API, only OsmAnd Android has used the integration point. However, due to the very sophisticated setup as a Public Blockchain, it took too many resources to maintain, and the project has been discontinued.
        </p>
        <p><a href="/backup/">The contributed data</a> (~4000 uploaded images on IPFS) to the project and the <a href="/data">blockchain metadata</a> will be available under <b>Public Domain license</b> for the next 3 months.</p>
        <p>The main result of the project is the OpenDB blockchain that stores and processes a lot of information and provides SQL database access with indexes - <b><a href="https://github.com/OpenPlaceReviews/opendb" target="_blank">OpenDB GitHub</a></b>. The blockchain serves the purpose of a Public API, including replication, and guarantees openness for everybody. The SQL database provides full access to process 10M objects in a reasonable time.</p>
        <p>As an alternative project, we recommend looking at <a href="https://mangrove.reviews/" target="_blank">Mangrove reviews</a>, which has shown sustainable growth in recent years.</p>
