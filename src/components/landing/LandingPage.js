            Big commercial companies collect millions of user reviews worldwide via all
            possible ways and make huge money on it. Sometimes they manipulate them in
            advertisers interest. None of them wants these data to be open and available
            for everyone. The amount of data they collect leads to global privacy issues.
            They create a monopoly on something that should belong to users.
          </p>

            We‚Äôve seen this already with‚Ä¶<br />
            ‚Ä¶ world knowledge monopoly: thus Wikipedia.org was born.<br />
            ‚Ä¶ world map data monopoly: thus OpenStreetMap.org was born.
